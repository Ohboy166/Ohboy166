# 💫 About Me:

Hey there! I'm Lukas, a Computer Science Student based in Germany.

🐞 I've been debugging since 2020 and continually embracing new challenges and learning experiences.

📚 Currently, I'm dedicated to mastering C, C++, and delving into the world of the Gtk Framework and Low-Level Programming.

🎯 My immediate goal is to successfully complete my university studies. Meanwhile, I find profound fascination in the intricate world of programming.

💡 Fun fact: Did you know that the letter designation "C" was chosen as a continuation from the programming language "B," developed at Bell Laboratories?
